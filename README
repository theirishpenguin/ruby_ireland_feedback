= Ruby Ireland Feedback Plugin for Rails

Ruby Ireland Feedback is a Ruby on Rails plugin that is planned to be a Rails 3 compatible version of Jean-Sebastien Boulanger's excellent Feedback plugin at https://github.com/jsboulanger/feedback

== Current State

* An empty Rails 3 gem
* Nothing else done
* We believe if we build it they will come! Or at least leave feedback...

== Motivation

Jean-Sebastien Boulanger's Feedback plugin rocks. We'd like to make it work for Rails 3 peeps.

== Building or Installing the gem 
You can do one 
* Building the (currently functionless) gem
  cd ruby_ireland_feedback
  rake build
  You can then gem install the resulting gem
* Bundle installing the (currently functionless) gem
  cd ruby_ireland_feedback
  bundle install

== Acknowledgements

Thanks to Jean-Sebastien Boulanger for the original feedback gem.
